## Introduction


## Soil water balance and plant drought stress

Eco-hydrological processes are fundamental for the simulation models included in the `medfate` package. Eco-hydrological processes can be divided into local and landscape processes. By local processes we refer to the soil water balance of forest stands. Processes affecting soil water content include rainfall, canopy interception, infiltration and runoff, percolation and deep drainage, soil evaporation and plant transpiration. In `medfate`, the soil water balance of a forest is primarily used to predict drought stress for living plants in it. Soil water balance can be studied for a single forest stand using function  `swb()` or for multiple stands distributed spatially using function `swbpoints()` or `swbgrid()`. When input data is in form of continuous spatial variation of forests over a landscape, the `medfate` package allows studying local soil water balance in combination with water discharge from one cell to the other (a landscape hydrological process). This is done using function `swbgrid()`. 


Functions `swb()` and `swbpoints()`  may be used to:

1. Monitor or forecast temporal variation in soil water content in particular stands (for example to estimate mushroom yield).
2. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in particular stands (for example to anticipate mortality events).
3. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of fuel moisture in particular stands (for example to monitor wildfire risk).

Function `swbgrid()` may be used to:

1. Determine areas where particular plant species have high vulnerability to suffer from drought stress.
2. Partition the total rainfall in given area among: 
    i) water evaporated from canopy interception or bare soil evaporation
    ii) water transpired by plants
    iii) water exported via runoff or deep drainage into the water table and river streams.

## Forest growth

Changes in leaf area and plant growth are key to evaluate the influence of climatic conditions on forest structure and function. Processes affecting annual changes leaf area and plant size are those involved water and carbon balances, as well as those affecting growth directly. Processes influencing plant water balance include those affecting soil water content, such as rainfall, canopy interception, infiltration and runoff, percolation and deep drainage, soil evaporation and plant transpiration. Carbon balance arises from the relationship between plant photosynthesis and respiration, although carbon reserves play a role in the availabity of carbon for growth. Water and carbon balances are coupled through the regulation of transpiration done by stomata. Plant growth is affected by the availability of carbon (source limitation), but also by temperature and water status (sink limitation). 

Package `medfate` includes allows simulating plant growth of a set of cohorts (competing for light and water) in a single forest stand using function `growth()` or for multiple stands distributed spatially using function `growthpoints()`. Leaf area of plants can be severely decreased by drought stress, causing an increase in dead leaf area and affecting carbon and water fluxes. Functions `growth()` and `growthpoints()` may be used to:

1. Monitor or forecast temporal variation in water fluxes and soil water content in particular stands (for example to estimate regulation ecosystem services) taking into account processes determining plant growth.
2. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of plant drought stress in particular stands(for example to anticipate mortality events) taking into account processes determining plant growth.
3. Monitor or forecast temporal variation of live fuel moisture and the amount of standing dead and live fuels in particular stands (for example to monitor wildfire risk).
